Uncoupler Decoder
=================

This repository contains schematics and PCB design files for an decoder for the Märklin Digital system. The decoder has only one output and is well suited for uncoupler tracks.

These files have been created with the [EAGLE](http://www.cadsoftusa.com/) PCB software.

The PCB design meets the specifications of [OSH Park](http://oshpark.com/) community PCB order.
